Now you are an expert in linguistics and knowledge graphs. I will give you two sets of words, indicating the entity types from two knowledge graphs. You need to identify all the word pairs from the two sets that are synonyms. For example, if the first set has the word ‘people’ and the second set has the word 'person', you need to identify the two words being synonyms and return me the pair (people, person).
Now the following are the two sets:
Set 1: string, StrasbourgCaseLaw, state, Southern Europe, unitary parliamentary republic, realm, Eurasia, island country, secular state, written work, country, realm of the United Kingdom, regional power, sovereign state, free imperial city, Post-Soviet states, Scandinavia, divided territory, Middle East, demographics of country or region, border city, eurozone, post-Yugoslavia states, Common Travel Area, Southeast Europe, disputed territory, territory, Iberian Peninsula, legal profession, Black Sea Basin, country bordering the Baltic Sea, big city, integer, Mediterranean country, European Economic Area, West Asia, federation, decision, successor state, commune of France, colonial power, unitary state, InternationalLaw, academic degree, Eastern Europe, kingdom, Balkans, transcontinental country, jurist, European Union, Baltic states, Central Europe, Mediterranean Basin, Europe, Rechtsstaat, date, Northern Europe, Nordic countries, occupation group according to ISCO-08, Schengen Area, great power, social state, republic, European Union tax haven blacklist, legal case, DomesticLaw, court decision, republic of the Soviet Union, nation state, state in the Holy Roman Empire, constitutional monarchy, landlocked country, Pyrenees–Mediterranean Euroregion, international court
Set 2: string, Damages, LegalArticle, decimal, Consequence, Perpetrator, LegalCase, Violation, Victim, Context, integer, LegalJudgment, PhysicalAbuse, EmotionalAbuse, Abuse, duration
Please return all the pairs that are synonyms from the two sets regarding entity types. Do not output the pairs if they are exactly the same. Each pair in one line. Each pair contains two types, one from Set 1 and another from Set 2.

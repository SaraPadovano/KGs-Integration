Now you are an expert in linguistics and knowledge graphs. I will give you two sets of words, indicating the entity types from two knowledge graphs. You need to identify all the word pairs from the two sets that are synonyms. For example, if the first set has the word ‘people’ and the second set has the word 'person', you need to identify the two words being synonyms and return me the pair (people, person) or for example, if you have StrasbourgCaseLaw in the first set and LegalCase in the second (StrasbourgCaseLaw, LegalCase).
Now the following are the two sets:
Set 1: string, StrasbourgCaseLaw, commune of France, jurist, European Economic Area, Mediterranean country, transcontinental country, Pyrenees–Mediterranean Euroregion, realm of the United Kingdom, Central Europe, social state, republic, eurozone, country, federation, demographics of country or region, post-Yugoslavia states, unitary parliamentary republic, Common Travel Area, state, legal profession, constitutional monarchy, InternationalLaw, Rechtsstaat, Southeast Europe, seculararchy, Mediterranean Basin, regional power, disputed territory, unitary state, Baltic states, country bordering the Baltic Sea, integer, Schengen Area, landlocked country, Scandinavia, nation state, European Union tax haven blacklist, kingdom, legal case, big city, Eurasia, Northern Europe, Balkans, Eastern Europe, Post-Soviet states, sovereign state, occupation group according to ISCO-08, great power, European Union, successor state, written work, free imperial city, border city, Black Sea Basin, republic of the Soviet Union, date, Nordic countries, Southern Europe, colonial power, state in the Holy Roman Empire, decision, court decision, island country, DomesticLaw, divided territory, academic degree, international court, Europe, realm, West Asia, territory, Middle East, Iberian Peninsula
Set 2: hasLegalJudgment, LegalJudgment, hasConsequence, hasLegalArticle, PhysicalAbuse, hasVictim, duration, hasLegalCase, hasRelatedTo, Perpetrator, LegalCase, decimal, Violation, hasContext, integer, Abuse, hasPerpetrator, Context, hasDamages, Victim, Damages, EmotionalAbuse, string, Consequence, LegalArticle
Please return all the pairs that are synonyms from the two sets regarding entity types. Do not output the pairs if they are exactly the same. Remember you only need to return the pairs, each pair in one line. Each pair contain two types, one from Set 1 and another from Set 2, in the format (type1, type2). Please pay very attention that they have to be synonyms or have a strong semantic connection. For example (jurist, perpatator) are not synonyms.

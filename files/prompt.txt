Now you are an expert in linguistics and knowledge graphs. I will give you two sets of words, indicating the entity types from two knowledge graphs. You need to identify all the word pairs from the two sets that are synonyms. For example, if the first set has the word ‘people’ and the second set has the word 'person', you need to identify the two words being synonyms and return me the pair (people, person) or for example, if you have StrasbourgCaseLaw in the first set and LegalCase in the second (StrasbourgCaseLaw, LegalCase).
Now the following are the two sets:
Set 1: StrasbourgCaseLaw, string, federation, realm of the United Kingdom, Europe, legal case, integer, republic, wikidata_entity, date, social state, Rechtsstaat, transcontinental country, divided territory, territory, unitary parliamentary republic, demographics of country or region, European Union tax haven blacklist, jurist, kingdom, Southern Europe, republic of the Soviet Union, academic degree, country, Post-Soviet states, Scandinavia, successor state, disputed territory, Eurasia, landlocked country, European Union, Balkans, border city, big city, colonial power, constitutional monarchy, Common Travel Area, Central Europe, country bordering the Baltic Sea, great power, commune of France, Black Sea Basin, Eastern Europe, DomesticLaw, state, state in the Holy Roman Empire, decision, unitary state, West Asia, Baltic states, realm, Nordic countries, Mediterranean country, Middle East, legal profession, free imperial city, Southeast Europe, Northern Europe, regional power, InternationalLaw, written work, secular state, Mediterranean Basin, Iberian Peninsula, post-Yugoslavia states, occupation group according to ISCO-08, eurozone, nation state, Pyrenees–Mediterranean Euroregion, sovereign state, Schengen Area, international court, European Economic Area, court decision, island country
Set 2: hasLegalJudgment, LegalJudgment, hasConsequence, hasLegalArticle, PhysicalAbuse, hasVictim, duration, hasLegalCase, hasRelatedTo, Perpetrator, LegalCase, decimal, Violation, hasContext, integer, Abuse, hasPerpetrator, Context, hasDamages, Victim, Damages, EmotionalAbuse, string, Consequence, LegalArticle
Please return all the pairs that are synonyms from the two sets regarding entity types. Do not output the pairs if they are exactly the same. Remember you only need to return the pairs, each pair in one line. Each pair contain two types, one from Set 1 and another from Set 2, in the format (type1, type2). Please pay very attention that they have to be synonyms or have a strong semantic connection. For example (jurist, perpatator) are not synonyms.
